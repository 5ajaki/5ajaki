# 5ajaki  
> Building tools for Ethereum’s infrastructure, transparent governance, and smarter AI integrations.

I focus on building at the intersection of **smart contracts**, **AI**, and **open-source tooling**, mostly in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lately a lot of my attention has been on governance related projects.  
I prioritize elegant, simple, composable solutions that don’t need a manual to understand. I iterate often, learn from mistakes, and collaborate whenever possible. I also tinker with AI to make Web3 smarter 🤖.

---

## 🔧 What I Work On

- 🗳 **DAO Infrastructure** – Automating proposals and treasury ops with Safe and ENS  
- 🧠 **AI x Web3** – LLM dashboards, embeddings, and MCP server experiments  
- 🕸 **Multi-sig Scripting** – Batch calldata and token flows for Gnosis Safe  
- 🔍 **Ethereum Data Pipelines** – Querying Etherscan, The Graph, and Postgres

## 🌍 Open Source Commitment

Most of what I build here is **open-source**, licensed under MIT, GNU, or Creative Commons. I believe in public-good development—tools that empower the community, foster transparency, and drive Web3 forward. If my code helps you, I’d love to hear about it. 

---

## 💡 Why I Build

I believe in infrastructure that’s transparent and tools that empower without overwhelming. Whether it’s a multi-sig script or an AI-driven dashboard, I’m here to make Web3 more legible and less regret-prone. (Also, I’m a minimalist at heart—less clutter, more clarity, in code and life.)

## 🔎 Currently Exploring

I’m diving deeper into AI-Web3 intersections—think LLMs for on-chain analytics or embeddings for DAO proposals. Got ideas? Let’s chat!
